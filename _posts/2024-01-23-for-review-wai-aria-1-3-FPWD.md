the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working 
Group published the First Public Working Draft (FPWD) of [Accessible Rich 
Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/WD-wai-aria-1.3-20240123/).

This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications.

Major changes since ARIA 1.2 include:

* addition of new roles, including `suggestion`, `comment`, and `mark`
* addition of new properties, including `aria-description`, `aria-braillelabel`, and `aria-brailleroledescription`
* updates to `aria-details` to allow multiple IDrefs

The Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group seeks feedback on any aspect of the specification.  Additional changes are in the [changelog](https://www.w3.org/TR/2024/WD-wai-aria-1.3-20240123/#changelog).

To share feedback, please open a new issue in the [w3c aria 
GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria/issues/new).
If this is not feasible, send email to:

In-progress updates to the document are available in the [Editors' Draft](https://w3c.github.io/aria/).

The purpose of First Public Working Drafts (FPWDs) is to gather review and input from the community. The WAI-ARIA 1.3 specification is intended to become a Recommendation following the W3C Process.
