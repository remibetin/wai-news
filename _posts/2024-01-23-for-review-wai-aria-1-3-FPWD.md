[WAI-ARIA 1.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.3/) is now a First Public Working Draft (FPWD). WAI-ARIA provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. These semantics allow authors to convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies. A list of what's changed since WAI-ARIA 1.2 is in the [changelog](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.3/#changelog).
